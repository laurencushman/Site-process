						<h1>Audience and Goals</h1>
						<p class="info">What are the goals for this website? How can this website best serve the intended audience?</p>
					</header>
				<!--Audience-->
					  <div>
						  <h2>Audience</h2>
						  <p>I used sticky notes to define the audience that the Anderson Arts Center intends to reach. I began by researching groups of people in the community to determine specific demographics. After gaining a better understanding of the audience, I was able to cater the website to the needs of the audience.</p>
						  <img src="images/s1.jpg" alt="" class="image fit" />
						<!--directly involved-->
						  <div class="row">
							<div class="6u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/s2.jpg" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>
							<div class="6u$"><h3>Directly Involved</h3>
								<p>I started by defining the groups directly involved with the Anderson Arts Center. In my research I found that teachers, children, students, local artists, and people of all ages that are interested in creating or viewing art. These groups are all directly involved in creating art, and for teachers, leading classes on creating art as well. I included a category of all people interested in the creation or viewing of art, as well. There are people of all ages that may not fall into the previous categories but are equally involved in the arts.</p></div>
							<div class="row">
								<div class="6u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/s3.jpg" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>
								<div class="6u$"><h3>Peripherally Relevant</h3>
									<p>After identifying groups directly involved with the Anderson Arts Center, I considered groups that are peripherally involved. I listed grandparents and parents in this category. Senior citizens are the largest group to contribute monetarily to the arts, but they are not the most involved group. However, if they have grandchildren interested in the arts, they are more likely to become involved by attending shows, recitals, and galleries. The same goes for parents. Parents may be directly involved and sign up for classes, especially if they are geared towards families.</p>
									<p>It is important to consider these two groups when one of the demographics most directly involved is children, who cannot sign up for classes and events themselves. The website should focus on a parent as the user but the content will be what interests kids.</p></div>
							<div class="row">
								<div class="6u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/s4.jpg" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>
								<div class="6u$"><h3>Connections</h3>
									<p>Next, I considered how the Anderson Arts Center connects to its audience. I focused on three categories of connection: fans, skeptics, and what groups the arts center needed most on their side to successfully connect with the community. For fans, I listed children, who take classes and create art, and senior citizens, who are the largest age group to spend money on art. I placed parents and donors under the category of skeptics. Both of these groups contribute money, and the arts center needs to meet their expectations, so they feel like their money is being used wisely. As for groups that the arts center needs on their side, I listed parents, local artists, and teachers as groups to consider. Parents are needed to get their kids involved, local artists so that the arts center has work to display, and teachers to teach classes at the arts center.</p></div>
							<div class="row">
							    <div class="6u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/s5.jpg" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>
								<div class="6u$"><h3>Extra Revenue</h3>
									<p>I then began to think about ways the arts center makes money other than the approaches I mentioned earlier through donations and class and event sign-ups. The Anderson Arts Center does have an additional source of revenue. This extra revenue comes from renting out various spaces on the weekend. This is not directly related to the arts, but it helps fund the arts and draws attention to the arts center.</p></div>
							<div class="row">
								<div class="6u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/s6.jpg" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>
								<div class="6u$"><h3>Volunteers/Involvement</h3>
									<p>The Anderson Arts Center provides ample opportunity for volunteers and community involvement. For volunteer experience, members of the community can assist an art teacher in leading a class. This is a perfect opportunity for high school students and young adults. As for involvement with the Anderson Arts Center, there are a few key paid and unpaid opportunities. For example, art students can submit art for juried shows or galleries to gain experience in the art world. As for necessary employees, teachers and representatives are crucial for the many events the arts center offers. The Anderson Arts Center employs teachers to lead classes and events. They also hire people to work as art representatives who serve as a point of contact during rental space use.</p></div>
						
				<!--Overarching Goals-->
						<div>
						  <h2>Overarching Goals</h2>
						  <p>In order to cater to the needs of the audience, I first explored the needs and goals of the client. From there I was able to identify the goals of the audience when visiting the Anderson Arts Center. Finally, with the priorities of the client and audience in mind, I considered how to combine the two groups and create an effective website.</p>

				<!--Specific Goals-->
						<div>
							<h2>Specific Goals</h2>
							<p>After gathering the information above pertaining to overarching goals, I focused on crafting specific goals to move this project forward. I broke apart the audience into more specific user groups. Then I focused on details by determining the goals of each user, and the appropriate actions needed to accomplish each goal. By taking these details into consideration, I can create the website to be functional for the user.</p>
