				<!--Audience-->
					  <div>
						  <h2>Audience</h2>
						  <p>I used sticky notes to define the audience that the Anderson Arts Center intends to reach. I began by researching groups of people in the community to determine specific demographics. After gaining a better understanding of the audience, I was able to cater the website to the needs of the audience.</p>

							<div class="6u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/s2.jpg" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>
							<div class="6u$"><h3>Directly Involved</h3>
								<p>I started by defining the groups directly involved with the Anderson Arts Center. In my research I found that teachers, children, students, local artists, and people of all ages that are interested in creating or viewing art.</p></div>

						  <h2>Overarching Goals</h2>
						  <p>In order to cater to the needs of the audience, I first explored the needs and goals of the client. From there I was able to identify the goals of the audience when visiting the Anderson Arts Center. Finally, with the priorities of the client and audience in mind, I considered how to combine the two groups and create an effective website.</p>

						<div>
							<h2>Specific Goals</h2>
							<p>After gathering the information above pertaining to overarching goals, I focused on crafting specific goals to move this project forward. I broke apart the audience into more specific user groups. Then I focused on details by determining the goals of each user, and the appropriate actions needed to accomplish each goal. By taking these details into consideration, I can create the website to be functional for the user.</p>
