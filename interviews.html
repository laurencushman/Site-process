								<h3>Addy Smith</h3>
								<p>Addy Smith is the Event and Operations Director at the Anderson County Arts Center. She allowed me to interview her about the Arts Centerâ€™s current website.

								<h4>What is the main goal of the website?</h4>
								<p>Addy first mentioned education and awareness surrounding the arts as a priority. She mentioned that a goal of the website is to serve as an information hub. The website covers what classes are offered, when to visit, and current exhibits at the Arts Center.</p>
								<h4>What would you change about the site? (Is there anything you would take out of the site? Anything you would include?)</h4>
								<p>Addy talked about wanting someone strictly devoted to the website. Someone to add information, update event details, and freshen up the site. As part of giving the website a new look, Addy wants to include a new homepage. As for the rest of the site, her goal is to consolidate information and get rid of any outdated or redundant information.</p>
								<h4>What is the main reason someone would visit your site? What is the most frequent reason for someone visiting the site?</h4>
								<p>Class information and class registration are the most frequent use of the website.</p>

					  <h2>User Interviews</h2>
					  <p>Kathleen and Brian Noblitt are parents of three energetic little boys. They fit one of the main demographics: parents that would sign their children up for art classes at the Arts Center. I chose them to interview because their boys would love the art classes the Arts Center has to offer, and Brian and Kathleen can test the effectiveness of their website.</p>
